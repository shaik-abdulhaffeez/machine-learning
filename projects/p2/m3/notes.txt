** Types of errors: 
in machine learing, two types of errors easy to make, oversimplifying and overcomplicating the problem.
1. underfitting
    - one characterstic is, it doesnt do well in training set
    - Error due to bias
2. overfitting
    - does wll in the training set, but it tends to memorize it instead of learning the characterstics of it.
    - not done good at test set
    - Error due to variance
